A templated class that compares a class on one of its public data members. Comparison is transparent, so we can also compare directly to the value of the member. This is practical if you want to sort the same class on multiple members. Furthermore if you have a associative container of heavy objects sorted by a lightweight member, this enables you to search the container only by the lightweight member type without constructing a heavy object.
